Simple Linear Regression to predict Student grades. 

**Aim**: The aim of this project is simply to predict student grades based on a single independent variable. 

**Methodology**: To predict student grades accurately, we will assess and clean the data as necessary. Next, we will conduct some Exploratory Data Analysis. Afterward, we will divide the data into Train-Test portions using an 80-20% split. We will then fit a linear regression model to the training data and apply it to the test data. Finally, we will evaluate the model results. 

**Model Result**: To know the capabilities of our model, we will evaluate the Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R^2, and Adj R^2.

From our results, we can conclude that:
- MSE - 23.3
- RMSE - 4.8
- MAE - 4.1
- R^2 - 0.966
- Adj R^2 - 0.964
